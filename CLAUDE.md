## projectmem (MANDATORY)

This project uses projectmem for persistent memory + workflow rules.

SESSION START — call these three MCP tools, in this order, BEFORE
answering ANY question about this project:

  1. `get_instructions()` — loads the project's mandatory workflow
     rules. Without this you will not know how to log work
     correctly, when to use `add_note` vs `add_decision`, or how
     the event log is structured.
  2. `get_summary()` — loads project content. Do NOT answer from
     conversation history or by re-reading package.json / README /
     source files.
  3. `get_project_map()` — loads structural layout when relevant.

BEFORE modifying ANY file:
  - Call `precheck_file(path)` — check failure history first.

DURING work — use MCP write tools, NEVER edit `.projectmem/`
files directly via filesystem write:
  - On a bug discovery → `log_issue(summary, location)`.
  - After each fix attempt → `record_attempt(summary, outcome)`.
  - After confirmation → `record_fix(summary)`.
  - On a design choice → `add_decision(summary)`.
  - On a gotcha / setup detail → `add_note(summary)`.

Editing `.projectmem/summary.md` or `.projectmem/PROJECT_MAP.md`
directly bypasses event logging and breaks audit replay. The
summary file regenerates from `events.jsonl` automatically — write
via the MCP tools and the summary will follow.

Do not re-scan source files when MCP tools can give you the same
answer in ~500 tokens instead of ~5000. This is not optional.
